# Biased-LLM-s

This is a Project from the Uni course "AI - Werkstatt" where we analyse how biased modern LLM's really are.
We focus mainly on scholarships and use different ones to test multiple locally deployed LLM's and try to find out how biased each of them "react" to differently filled out scholarships.
